Moderately unhinged stock prediction AI with LSTM layers and genetic algorithm optimization. Written in your favorite AI language, TypeScript.

Note: This is not suitable for real trading or financial advice. It is a learning project. There is no runtime performance, unsuitable trading prediction accuracy, and a longer than 1ms ping time to any given stock exchange.

Some choice non-implemented features:
- Automated hyperparameter tuning
- Advanced data preprocessing
- Multiple target features
- Any sort of measures against overfitting
